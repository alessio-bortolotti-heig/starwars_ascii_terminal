# Star Wars ASCII Art

This Python script allows you to watch Star Wars in ASCII art directly in your terminal.

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to experience Star Wars in a unique way? Now you can! This Python script takes ASCII art frames from the `starwars.txt` file and displays them in your terminal, allowing you to enjoy the iconic opening crawl of Star Wars right from your command line.

## Getting Started

To run the script and start watching Star Wars in ASCII art, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-ascii.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**

   ```bash
   cd starwars_ascii_terminal
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python3 starwars.py
   ```

The script will read the ASCII art frames from `starwars.txt` and display them in your terminal. It hides the cursor, prints each frame with a delay, and then reactivates the cursor.
